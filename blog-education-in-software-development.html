				I have always been fascinated with technology and computers since I was little. I would often spend hours watching videos learning more about the workings of computers and occasionally go on this website called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> which introduced me to the concept of programming.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2018 I attended a college taster programme in National College of Ireland. In the programme we were tasked of creating a game made with C# in the popular game engine Unity, this helped have a good idea on what software or game development is like.
			</p>
			<p>
				I made little ventures into exploring the world of software developments through second level education until I have graduated, then I went on to do a 1-year course in software development at Dun Laoghaire Further Education Institute (DFEI). During my time at DFEI, I have covered topics such as the Software Development Life Cycle, Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, Networking and other topics that help with my career. The programming languages I have learnt in the course are Visual Basic .NET, and Java and website building languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
